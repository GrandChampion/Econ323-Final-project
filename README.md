# Topic
The COVID-19 pandemic has had a significant impact on the tourism industry worldwide. 
We are going to include the following factors in our project by retrieving data on countries that were popular tourist destinations prior to the Covid-19 pandemic and conducting a comparative analysis of the changes in the tourism industry before and after the outbreak.

## Travel restrictions
Many countries have implemented travel restrictions, including border closures, quarantine requirements, and visa suspensions, which have severely limited international travel.

## Reduced demand
Due to fear of contracting the virus, many people have canceled or postponed their travel plans, leading to a sharp decline in demand for tourism.

## Closure of tourism-related businesses
Many hotels, airlines, restaurants, and other tourism-related businesses have been forced to close temporarily or permanently due to the pandemic.

## Unemployment
The tourism industry is a major employer, and the pandemic has led to widespread job losses in the sector, including those in hotels, airlines, and travel agencies.

## Economic impact
The tourism industry contributes significantly to the economy of many countries. The pandemic has led to a severe economic downturn in many countries, with some countries experiencing a recession due to the decline in tourism.

## Shift in travel preferences
The pandemic has also led to a shift in travel preferences, with many people opting for domestic travel, road trips, and outdoor activities instead of international travel and crowded tourist destinations.

Overall, the COVID-19 pandemic has had a significant impact on the tourism industry, and it may take some time for the sector to recover fully.
