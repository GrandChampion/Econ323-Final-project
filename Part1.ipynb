    "To examine the impacts of Covid-19 on the tourism industry, we will analyze the comparisons of outbound and inbound visitors and tourism expenditure between year 2019 and 2020 in Korea, Japan, Mexico and the USA. The data is from the OECD database. Since the limitation of the database, Brazil, China and Canada are excluded. We import the data of the numbers of international arrivals and departures and the amount of total international tourism expense in each country. The three bar charts below visualize the differences before and after Covid-19 pandemic and we can witness the direct destructive effects of Covid-19 on the tourism industry.  "
